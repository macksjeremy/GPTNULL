"Sexhow railway station was a railway station located in the town of Sexhow, on the Cumbrian Coast Line in North West England. The station was opened by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on 7 October 1870. It was closed to passengers on 5 January 1950, and to goods on 12 May 1965. 

The station building is now a private residence. There is a small amount of trackage remaining near the building, used currently by a local agricultural business.",0
"Sexhow railway station was a railway station built to serve the hamlet of Sexhow in North Yorkshire, England. The station was on the North Yorkshire and Cleveland's railway line between  and , which opened in 1857. The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby & Pickering Railway at . Sexhow station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located  south of Stockton, and  west of Battersby railway station. History
The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as . Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with  railway station, which was originally named Carlton.",1
"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, animate or inanimate, have a spirit or ""etiäinen"" that lives there. Etiäinen can manifest in many forms, but is usually described as a kind, elderly woman with white hair. She is the guardian of natural places and often helps people in need. 

Etiäinen has been a part of Finnish culture for centuries and is still widely believed in today. Folklorists study etiäinen to understand Finnish traditions and how they have changed over time.",0
"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",1
"In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem states that for every real-valued function there exists an inverse function that satisfies the following two conditions:

1. The inverse function is continuous at every point where the original function is continuous.
2. The inverse function is unique up to a constant multiple of the given function's derivative at any given point.",0
"In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.
In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement
For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if  is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then  is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at  is the reciprocal of the derivative of  at :",1

"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.

The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.

The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.",0
"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.",1

"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.
3) The rate at which jobs are created must be equal to the rate at which people want to work.",0
"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.",1

"Death of Cook is the name of a small, unidentified extinct hominin species. It is so far the only known member of its genus and family.

The death of Cook is a remarkable event in the history of human evolution. Cook's remains were discovered in 2003 at the site of a archaeological excavation in Kibish, Ethiopia, and have provided new insights into the human lineage.

Cook was about 1.5 meters tall and had an estimated weight of about fifty kilograms. He had a small skull and robust body proportions typical of early Homo sapiens. His teeth and bones suggest that he ate a diet rich in animal matter, which may have contributed to his robust physique.

Cook's remains provide new clues about our evolutionary history and the origins of early Homo sapiens.

Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history.  The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts.  The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians.  The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent.  
  
The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).",1
"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. 

Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government. 


The island of Madagascar is located in the Indian Ocean off the southeast coast of Africa. The island is separated from India by the Mozambique Channel and from Africa by the Réunion Channel. The total land area is approximately 25,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles). The",0
"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.",1

"Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.",1

"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters is a 2013 book by American environmental historian Kate Brown. The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places. However, each city witnessed what Brown terms ""slow-motion disasters"" via the slow, and usually controlled, release of high levels of radiation into their surrounding environments. Awards

"A full-time job is employment in which a person works a set number of hours each week, typically 40 hours. In some countries, full-time employment is the norm, while in others it is less common. 

The term ""full-time job"" can refer to a variety of different types of employment, including traditional jobs where a person works a set number of hours each day, week, or month, as well as part-time jobs where a person works fewer hours each week than 40. In some cases, people may work full time but be paid for fewer hours worked than 40 per week because their employer operates on a shift system. 

There are many reasons why people might work full time instead of part time. Some people want to have more flexibility in their daily schedule, while others may want to have more stability in their work life. Full-time jobs can offer benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid vacation days.",0
"A full-time job is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by their employer. Overview
Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.",1

"Yu Lihua (, 28 November 1929 – 30 April 2020) was a Chinese writer who authored over thirty works - novels, short stories, newspaper articles and translations in a span of sixty years. She is regarded as ""one of the five most influential Chinese-born women writers in the postwar era and the progenitor of the Chinese students' overseas genre.""  She wrote primarily in Chinese, drawing on her experience as a Chinese émigré in postwar America. She was celebrated in the diaspora for giving voice to what she called the ""rootless generation"" — émigrés who had left for a better life but remained nostalgic for their homeland. She was more than a successful writer, but a bridge, a cultural ambassador between China and the US. In 1975, she was one of the first individuals to be invited back to China after relations between the two countries were re-opened. Her work, which until then had been blacklisted in China, began to focus on life in China.

He has composed in nearly all genres common to church music, including anthems, service music, hymn concertatos, organ music, music for handbell choir, and large-scale oratorios.  Powell's conservative, neo-Romantic style stems from his practical approach to composition.  According to Powell himself, he writes for ""choirs of twenty-five because that's what most choirs are.  When you come right down to it, most choirs are not of cathedral ability or size.   My pieces are all practical things and useful for specific occasions.""  His publications appear in The Hymnal 1982 as well as in the catalogs of most of the significant American publishers of church music.

"James Thomas Eaglestone (24 July 1923 – 14 October 2000) was an English cricketer who played 60 first-class cricket matches, initially for Middlesex in 1947, before moving to Glamorgan for the 1948 and 1949 seasons. Known largely for his skills as a fielder – for he found only moderate success with the bat – Eaglestone enjoys the unusual distinction of having featured in two different County Championship-winning sides in consecutive seasons. Career
Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77. 
 
Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest. He scored 595 runs at 18.59 in the 1948 season and 341 runs at 11.36 in 1949.",1

"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the eyes to change their response to a changed visual environment. It is a physiological process that underlies the detection and interpretation of images by the brain.

Adaptation is an important process in vision because it enables us to detect objects and scenes that are changing rapidly, such as when we are moving or when something new is happening. Our eyes usually adapt quickly to changes in our environment, but sometimes they can't adapt fast enough or they adapt in the wrong way. This can lead to problems with our vision, like when we can't see in low light or when we get headaches from viewing bright lights.

There are two main types of adaptation: positive and negative. Positive adaptation occurs when the eyes become more sensitive to light, and negative adaptation occurs when the eyes become less sensitive to light.",0
"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the retina of the eye to adjust to various levels of light. Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen.  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence ""setting"", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.  This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds. Efficiency 
The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.",1

"In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is a standing position with the feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, the weight shifted towards the ball of the foot, and the hands held close to the body.

The orthodox stance is considered to be one of the most effective stances in boxing. It allows a boxer to cover more ground with their footwork, and also keep their opponent at a distance by preventing them from landing clean punches.",0
"In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is one in which the boxer places their left foot farther in front of the right foot, thus having their weaker side closer to the opponent. Because it favors the stronger, dominant side—often the right side, see laterality—the orthodox stance is the most common stance in boxing and MMA. It is mostly used by right-handed boxers. Many boxing champions have fought in an orthodox stance. Alternative stances
The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox. Some fighters who are naturally left-handed fight in the orthodox stance with the advantage of a fast, hard jab and left hook, including Oscar De La Hoya, Sonny Liston, Miguel Angel Cotto, Gerry Cooney, and Marco Antonio Barrera.

Her father, Yun Kee Yuen worked for the Libby pineapple company as an office clerk and bookkeeper. Maul's family often spent summers in Moloka'i.  Maul's parents sent her and her siblings to stay with David Beckwith, the cousin of a family friend, in Wisconsin during World War II in order to protect them. Marybeth would later return to Moloka'i to practice law and to help her father in the 1950s. Maul and her family started the first Chinese restaurant on Moloka'i called Hop Inn in 1963.

"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, roughly speaking, a function whose behavior appears to be periodic, but for which there is not a precise mathematical description. Such functions can be difficult to analyze and predict, and their properties are not always well-understood.",0
"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, loosely speaking, a function of a real number that is periodic to within any desired level of accuracy, given suitably long, well-distributed ""almost-periods"". The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann. Almost periodicity is a property of dynamical systems that appear to retrace their paths through phase space, but not exactly. An example would be a planetary system, with planets in orbits moving with periods that are not commensurable (i.e., with a period vector that is not proportional to a vector of integers). A theorem of Kronecker from diophantine approximation can be used to show that any particular configuration that occurs once, will recur to within any specified accuracy: if we wait long enough we can observe the planets all return to within a second of arc to the positions they once were in.",1

Recorded between June 2012 and January 2013, the album used four drum sessions, and went through ten recording engineers before settling on Stephen George. The drums were recorded with session musician Christopher Crandall, in the absence of the band having a permanent drummer at the time. The album incorporated a variety of music styles based on its members, including punk rock, funk, and soul; it was mastered and mixed to have a ""more human"" and ""organic"" sound.

"In computing, the Windows Driver Model  (WDM) is the software architecture for drivers for the Windows operating system. It was first introduced with Windows 95 and has been refined since then. The WDM is a model-based system that sets out how different types of drivers interact with the operating system.

The WDM allows drivers to be written in a standard, modular fashion, which makes it easier for developers to create and maintain drivers. The WDM also allows drivers to access common functions and resources across all versions of Windows, making them more reliable.",0
"In computing, the Windows Driver Model  (WDM) also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model. Overview
WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows.  For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.",1

"British jazz is a form of music derived from American jazz. It reached Britain through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of World War I. Jazz began to be played by British musicians from the 1930s and on a widespread basis in the 1940s, often within dance bands. From the late 1940s, British ""modern jazz"", highly influenced by American Dixieland jazz and bebop, began to emerge and was led by figures such as Kenny Ball, Chris Barber, John Keating, John Dankworth, Tony Crombie and Ronnie Scott, while Ken Colyer, George Webb and Humphrey Lyttelton emphasised New Orleans, Trad jazz. From the 1960s British jazz began to develop more individual characteristics and absorb a variety of influences, including British blues, as well as European and World music influences.

"Let's Bowl is a scripted bowling game show that aired on the Comedy Central television network from 2001 to 2002 after a brief run on several TV stations across the U.S. in the mid-1990s, the first three being Minneapolis-St. Paul stations: KXLI-TV 41 (Now KPXM-TV), KLGT-TV 23 (now WUCW), and KARE channel 11. Overview
Hosts Steve ""Chopper"" Sedahl (himself) and Wally Hotvedt (Rich Kronfeld) wore outfits and headsets reminiscent of sportscasters of the 1970s and early 1980s, and did play-by-play as contestants bowled against each other. Described as a cross between The People's Court and Bowling for Dollars, the show had participants play against each other to settle feuds and win nearly worthless prizes. For example, in the second 1998 episode, a player received merchandise for a radio station that had been defunct for two years. Gift certificates for Old Country Buffet were common that year. Another episode gave a foodservice-sized can of tuna to the runner up, while the winner received a 2 gallon consumer-strength jug of Roundup.",1

"Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the",0
"Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method by which developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated ""sending district"" and transfer the rights to another ""receiving district"" to increase the density of their new development. The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ",1

"Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in England that record the arrangements between the king of England and certain groups of people, such as thegns (landholders) and freemen. They are seen as important sources of historical information about early medieval English society and economy.

Anglo-Saxon charters were written in Old English, the earliest form of the English language. They were generally created to enable people to exchange goods and services, or to confirm an agreement. The earliest known Anglo-Saxon charter is from the year 896, and the most recent is from 1236.

There are around 1,500 Anglo-Saxon charters in existence, and they provide a valuable insight into early medieval English society and economy. They are particularly useful for studying the relationship between the king and the different groups of people in early medieval England, as well as the ways in which economic activity was organised.",0
"Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in England which typically made a grant of land or recorded a privilege. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s: the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the eighth century, surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people. The term charter covers a range of written legal documentation, including diplomas, writs and wills. A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on parchment in Latin, but often contained sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a seal and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods. Land held by virtue of a charter was known as bookland.",1

"The Château de Kaysersberg (also: Schlossberg) is a ruined castle in the commune of Kaysersberg in the Haut-Rhin département  of France. History
The castle was built for Albin Woelflin, imperial bailiff for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, around 1220. The site was acquired in 1227 by the lords of Horbourg and Ribeaupierre. It had an important strategic role as it allowed the Empire to close off one of the routes across the Vosges Mountains towards Lorraine. The circular keep is the oldest part of the castle and one of the first of this type in the upper Rhine valley. It was designed at the same time as the keep at the Château de Pflixbourg. The first curtain wall, which included the keep, was replaced after 1261 by a wall enclosing the keep, according to a contemporary plan, which allowed an uninterrupted circuit of the walls and strengthened defences on the side likely to be attacked. 
In the 14th century, the castle was the residence of the imperial provost or bailiff. Following a fire, the enceinte was raised to 4 m. In the second half of the 15th century, the castle defences were modernised in response to developments in artillery and firearms; the crenels were closed with wooden shutters, the merlons were equipped with firing slits and the round walk was completely covered. In this period, the castle was merely a sub-bailliage and personnel were heavily reduced. During the German Peasants' War (1524/5), the castle was besieged.

The tournament is named for native Hawaiian, champion big wave surfer, and life-saving Waimea Bay lifeguard, Eddie Aikau.  Created in 1984 at nearby Sunset Beach, the invitational tournament moved to the notoriously big waved Waimea Bay, where Aikau's family maintains an ancestral tradition as caretakers of the Waimea Valley. It was formerly known as the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau after its sponsor Quiksilver, but the company and the Aikau family could not agree to terms for a new contract after the previous one expired in 2016. Tournament format
The tournament is known for a unique requirement that open-ocean swells reach a minimum height of  before the competition can be held. Open-ocean swells of this height generally translate to wave faces in the bay of  to . As a result of this requirement, the tournament has only been held nine times during the history of the event, most recently on February 25, 2016.",1
"Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers where the power supply is held at a constantvoltage. This eliminates the need for a power amplifier, as the loudspeakers are always powered by the same voltage.

Constant-voltage speaker systems offer several advantages over traditional power amplifiers. First, they are less likely to suffer from ""sag"" or ""pumping"" in the audio signal, as the power supply is held constant. Second, they can be more efficient, as the power amplifier is not required to work at peak performance all the time. Finally, they can be more tightly controlled, as there is no need for multiple power amplifiers or switches to vary the power to different speakers.

Constant-voltage speaker systems have been used in a variety of applications, including home theater and music playback. They are becoming more popular due to their efficiency and tight control",0
"Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers which are connected to an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems.  In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation
Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level.",1

The only inhabited locality on the island is the village of Bozcaada (population 150), which lies on the east coast. The Aegean Sea lies to the south and east, and to the west is the Gulf of Gökçeada. 

The island's name derives from its ancient inhabitants, the Tenedoi. Homer refers to them as one of the tribes inhabiting Dodona in The Iliad. The Tenedoi were later absorbed by the Mycenaean Greeks. 

Tenedos was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in the late 2nd millennium BC and was ruled by various dynasties throughout its history. It became part of the Roman Empire in 30 BC, and then part of the Byzantine Empire until it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire in 1453.

In 2018, the district had a population of 3023. The main industries are tourism, wine production and fishing. The island has been famous for its grapes, wines and red poppies for centuries. It is a former bishopric and presently a Latin Catholic titular see. Tenedos is mentioned in both the Iliad and the Aeneid, in the latter as the site where the Greeks hid their fleet near the end of the Trojan War in order to trick the Trojans into believing the war was over and into taking the Trojan Horse within their city walls. The island was important throughout classical antiquity despite its small size due to its strategic location at the entrance of the Dardanelles. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the Delian League, the empire of Alexander the Great, the Kingdom of Pergamon, the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire, before passing to the Republic of Venice. As a result of the War of Chioggia (1381) between Genoa and Venice the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The Ottoman Empire established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the Russians. During this invasion the town was burnt down and many Turkish residents left the island.",1

"The Betsy Ross House is a landmark in Philadelphia purported to be the site where the seamstress and flag-maker Betsy Ross (1752-1836) lived when she is said to have sewed the first American Flag. The origins of the Betsy Ross myth trace back to her relatives, particularly her grandsons, William and George Canby, and the celebrations of the Centennial of 1876.  Evidence for the precise location of Ross' home came from verification provided by several surviving family members, although the best archival evidence indicates the house would have been adjacent to the one that still stands today as The Betsy Ross House. The 1937 Philadelphia Guide noted that, after the current Betsy Ross House was selected as the Flag House, the adjacent building where Ross may have indeed lived ""was torn down to lessen the hazards of fire, perhaps adding a touch of irony to what may well have been an error in research."" Although the house is one of the most visited tourist sites in Philadelphia, the claim that Ross once lived there, and that she designed and sewed the first American flag, sometimes called the Betsy Ross flag, are considered false by most historians. The house sits on Arch Street, several blocks from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The front part of the building was built around 1740, in the Pennsylvania colonial style, with the stair hall and the rear section added 10 to 20 years later.

"Dnestr radar  and Dnepr radar , or simply radar, are two types of radars used for navigation and military purposes. A radar is an apparatus that uses radio waves to determine the range, direction, and altitude of objects.

The development of radars began in the early 20th century with the first successful experiments by British scientist Arthur Schuster.Radar was first used in combat during World War II, primarily on battlefields to detect aircraft, balloons and missiles. Since then, radar has become a key tool in navigation and air traffic control. It is also used for industrial purposes, such as monitoring pipeline gauges.

Today, both civilian and military radar operators use a variety of different technical systems. These systems use different frequencies and waveforms to create a image or representation of the target.",0

The origin of the Northwestern Maris belongs to the larger history of the Mari people. Most scientists, based on linguistic and archaeological data, associated them with being descendants of the north-western part of the Iron Age Gorodets culture. It was localized between the middle Volga's right tributaries Oka and Sura. In the 6th century AD Gorodets population moved to the north bank of Volga up to Vetluga and Bolshaya Kokshaga rivers. There they was greatly influenced by the Ananyino culture. The differences between Northwestern and other groups of Mari appeared in the 9th-10th centuries. In the 10th-13th centuries some related upper Volga Dyakovo tribes joined to Northwestern Maris and were assimilated by them.

"Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost (15 April 1802, Paris – 12 September 1863, Paris) was a French artist and writer.

Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost was born on 15 April 1802 in Paris. She was the daughter of Aimé Prévost, a celebrated French dramatist, and Zoë Arago, a noted feminist writer.

Prévost began her artistic career as an illustrator and caricaturist. In 1829, she published her first book, a collection of children's drawings titled ""Les Aventures de Toto"". In 1835, she published her first novel, ""L'Éducation sentimentale"".

Prévost's fame as an artist grew rapidly in the 1840s. She became one of the leading exponents of Romantic painting in France. Her most famous works from this period include ""La Joconde"" (1840), ""Napoléon Ier enfermé à Saint-Helena"" (1843), and ""Les Deux Magots"" (1875).

Prévost also became known for her poetry. Her best-known works from this period include the poetry collection ""Le Coeur sur la main"" (1848) and the novel ""La Mare au dessus des flots"" (1856).

"Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost (15 April 1802, Paris – 10 April 1861, Paris) was a French operatic soprano. She created leading roles in some of the most notable French opéras comiques of the first half of the nineteenth century, including ""Fra Diavolo"" by Daniel Auber and ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adolphe Adam. Career
Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost, also known as Zoé Prévost, had a younger brother, Eugene, who was a composer and conductor. Zoé studied singing at the Paris Conservatoire and made her debut at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, in 1821. The Opéra-Comique at that time presented operas light in tone and with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in ""La marquise de Brinvilliers"", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in ""Fra Diavolo"" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers. In the latter work, as in others, she appeared opposite her husband, leading tenor Jean-Baptiste Chollet, by whom she had one daughter, Caroline, who also achieved success as a singer under the stage name Mademoiselle Monrose. Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost also appeared in other French and Belgian opera houses.",1
"A secretory protein is any protein, whether produced by a cell or produced in the body, that is secreted from the cell into the extracellular space. This includes proteins that are released from cells in response to an external stimulus, such as activation of a signaling pathway, or proteins that are produced by cells on demand. Secretory proteins can be classified according to their mode of secretion, which can be exocytosis, endocytosis, or both.",0
"A secretory protein is any protein, whether it be endocrine or exocrine, which is secreted by a cell. Secretory proteins include many hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides.
Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production
The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores the translation of the secretory protein. The signal sequence is removed and the translation continues while the produced chain moves through the translocon (cotranslational translocation).",1
"The Horrorist was an occult and horror-themed comics anthology magazine published by DC Comics from 1978 to 1983. It was a spin-off of The Terror, which had been published by the company from 1974 to 1978.

The Horrorist was initially conceived as a supplement to The Terror, featuring longer stories and more extensive coverage of horror-related comics material than the standard comic book. However, it soon surpassed The Terror in both scope and popularity, leading to its own series and ultimately becoming an independent comic book publisher in its own right.

The Horrorist played an important role in popularizing occult and horror comics, particularly among mainstream American readers. It featured stories by such well-known creators as Steve Niles, Alan Moore, and Robert Kirkman, as well as lesser-known contributors who would go on to become major names in the field.

Despite its success, The Horrorist was short-lived; it ceased publication with issue #75 in 1983. Its influence can be seen in such contemporary comics anthologies as Dark Horse Presents and Vertigo Crime.",0

The Redpsotted Hawkfish was first formally described as Pseudocirrhites pinos in 1927 by the Bermudan naturalist Louis L. Mowbray with the type locality given as Point Francis on the Isle of Pines in Cuba. In 1829 the French zoologist Georges Cuvier described a species he called Cirrhites fasciatus, giving it a type locality of Puducherry in India. This is now considered to be an error, since the fish described most likely came from the Atlantic Ocean. When Theodore Nicholas Gill described the genus Amblycirrhitus in 1861 he used Cuvier's C. fasciatus as its type species. However, Cuvier's name was preoccupied by Edward Turner Bennett's 1828 usage of the name for a related species, A. pinos is the type species of Amblycirrhitus under Cuvier's invalid name. Mowbray's specific name pinos refers to the Isle of Pines.",1

The descendant of ethnic Romanian and Slovak miners, he was born in the Hungarian segment of Austria-Hungary. Raised by his mother after his father's death in World War I, he received financial support from local benefactors, who cultivated his artistic skill, particularly as a woodcarver. A citizen of Romania after the union of 1918, he was forced to drop out of school by economic circumstances, and worked for years in various industries and businesses, while also discovering his passion for beekeeping and gardening. He was drawn into far-left politics during the Great Depression, when he came to be influenced by radical artists such as Alexandru Ziffer, Aurel Popp, Vasile Kazar and Iosif Klein, who also introduced him to avant-garde experimentation. Vida was co-opted into the Union of Communist Youth and subsequently the Communist Party, producing propaganda art for both; this activity led to his temporary arrest in 1932 and 1933.

A critical edition of the poem based on unique manuscript of the work is found in a collection held in the British Museum (OR 2780) and published in a critical edition by Professor Jalal Matini, and in an English translation by Kaveh L Hemmat.

"Thaumaci or Thaumacus , was a town in ancient Arcadia, in the territory of Pheneus. It was situated on the river Acheron, about two stadia from the sea-shore, and about four from the river Alpheus. Thucydides mentions it as one of the towns in which the Peloponnesian War was chiefly carried on.

Thaumaci flourished under the government of Aristodemus, who appears to have been its founder and first ruler. Its extent is not accurately known, but it seems to have been small; for Thucydides says that it contained only two hundred houses, while Pliny puts its population at seven thousand five hundred. Thucydides also mentions that there were two temples in it, one to Apollo and the other to Hermes Trismegistus.

The town was captured by Antiochus III in 188 BC, after a long siege, and was subsequently destroyed.",0
"Thaumaci or Thaumacus , was a town and polis (city-state) of Phthiotis in Ancient Thessaly, was situated on the pass called Coela, on the road from Thermopylae and the Maliac Gulf passing through Lamia. The modern city of Domokos occupies its site. At this place, says Livy, the traveller, after traversing rugged mountains and intricate valleys, comes suddenly in sight of an immense plain like a vast sea, the extremity of which is scarcely visible. From the astonishment which it excited in the traveller, the city was supposed to have derived its name. It stood upon a lofty and precipitous rock. It was besieged by Philip V of Macedon in 199 BCE; but a reinforcement of Aetolians having made their way into the town, the king was obliged to abandon the siege. Thaumaci was taken by the consul Acilius in the war with Antiochus, 191 BCE. The modern town of Domokos occupies the site of Thaumaci, and at this place inscriptions were found containing the ancient name. Its situation and prospect are in exact accordance with the description of Livy, who copied from Polybius, an eye-witness. William Martin Leake observes that ""at the southern end of the town a rocky point, overtopping the other heights, commands a magnificent prospect of the immense plain watered by the Peneius and its branches."" The town was Christianised at an early date and a bishopric was set up (see Thaumacensis).",1

"The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Chicago, Illinois. Active from 1978 to 1992, the band was one of the earliest American bands to combine punk rock with heavy metal and progressive rock influences.

Formed in 1978, the Make-Up quickly became one of the leading lights of Chicago's burgeoning post-punk scene. Their blend of punk energy and heavy metal intensity placed them firmly at the forefront of a movement that was beginning to take shape in the city. 

The Make-Up's self-titled debut album was released in 1980 and quickly established them as one of Chicago's most popular and influential bands. The album was well received by both critics and fans alike, earning them a reputation as one of the city's most promising new bands. 

The following year saw the release of their second album, which saw the band expanding their sound further into progressive territory. The album was again well received by both fans and critics, and cemented the Make-Up's position as one of Chicago's leading post-punk outfits. 

In 1982, the Make-Up released their third album, which marked a significant change in direction for the band. Recorded at Studio 4 in London with production by David Bowie producer Tony Visconti, the album saw the band abandoning their punk roots in favour of a more experimental sound. 

Released in 1984, the album failed to achieve the same level of commercial success as their previous work, but it has since been recognised as one of the finest",0
"The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Washington, D.C. formed in 1995, consisting of ex-Nation of Ulysses frontman Ian Svenonius on vocals, James Canty on guitar and organ, Steve Gamboa on drums, and Michelle Mae on bass guitar.  The Make-Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member, Alex Minoff (of the groups Golden and Extra Golden), who played guitar with the group until the band's dissolution in early 2000. The Make-Up combined garage rock, soul, and a self-styled liberation theology to make a new genre they called ""Gospel Yeh-Yeh"".  This style led to an emphasis on live performances and interaction between the band and their audience, incorporating the audience into the performances as a ""fifth member"", creating what one reviewer described as """"highly energetic and participatory live shows"". Parallel to the band's gospel musical stylings, the Make-Up produced music under a communism-influenced political philosophy that they saw as counter to the capitalist form of modern rock and roll and pop music.",1

"Liah Greenfeld is an Israeli-American Russian-Jewish interdisciplinary scholar engaged in the scientific explanation of human social reality on various levels, beginning with the individual mind and ending with the level of civilization. She has been called ""the most iconoclastic""  of contemporary sociologists and her approach represents the major alternative to the mainstream approaches in social science. Throughout her analyses, she emphasizes the empirical foundation of claims that she makes about human thought and action, underlining the importance of logical consistency between different sources of evidence as well as between the many interrelated hypotheses that come together to help us explain complex human phenomena. Because our thought and action are rarely limited to one, conveniently isolated sphere of human existence but rather occur within the context of more than one area of our reality at the same time (e.g. the political, the religious, the economic, the artistic, etc.) Greenfeld highlights the fact that an empirical study of humanity must necessarily be interdisciplinary. Best known for her trilogy on nationalism -- Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Harvard University Press, 1992), The Spirit of Capitalism: Nationalism and Economic Growth (Harvard University Press, 2001) and Mind, Modernity, Madness: The Impact of Culture on Human Experience (Harvard University Press, 2013), Greenfeld has studied and written about the entire range of modern social reality, including art, literature, science, religion, love, mental illness, ideological politics, economic competition, and so on.",1

The properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 and 15 November 2002 respectively. History 
Waverley Reservoir No. 1, completed in 1887, was the last of four reservoirs built to augment the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). The other three reservoirs included: 
 Crown Street Reservoir, 1859
 Paddington Reservoir, 1864 (disused and no longer owned by Sydney Water), and 
 Woollahra Reservoir, 1880. 
However Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) was not supplied solely by Botany Swamps Water, because by 1886 the Hudson Scheme had come on line, supplying water from the Upper Nepean, prior to the completion of that Scheme in 1888. Water was pumped from Woollahra Reservoir for the first six years of its service, then from Crown Street Reservoir in 1893. From 1927 onwards Waterloo Pumping Station took over supply of the reservoir. The Waverley Reservoirs were the highest of the reservoirs intended to be supplied by Botany Swamps. However it soon became apparent that additional height was required for reticulation purposes. This led to the construction of two elevated steel tanks in 1894 (now demolished). With increasing demand, these tanks were eventually superseded by the present Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) and Waverley Reservoir No. 2, both completed in 1917. Final augmentation of supply took place in 1938 with the construction of Waverley Reservoir No. 3.",1

Cruentis began in 2012, between two friends Tyler DeMerchant on Vocals/Bass and Jesse Dean on Vocals/Guitars. The band added on Matt Sargent on Lead Guitars shortly afterward. The band, despite forming in 2012, remained musically silent until 2016. The band then recorded their debut album, Cold Stone, with the title track and ""The Blood That Divides"" being released as singles prior to the album's release. Cold Stone was released independently. Following the release of the album, they added Daniel Willsmore on drums, and recorded an EP, Dichotomy. However, following the EP's release, both Sargent and Willsmore seemingly departed from the band, leaving only founding members DeMerchant and Dean left in the band. The band would continue on as a two-piece, as both understood how to perform drums. In 2018, the band would sign with Nosral Recordings, home to bands such as Symphony of Heaven, Light Unseen, and Ascending King. Following their signing with the label, the band released their sophomore album, Alpha & Omega, with a lyric video for the title track also being released. The album received mixed to good reviews, with several sites giving a review rating of 7 or 8 out of 10. Nosral Recordings has since been disbanded, and Cruentis remains unsigned thus far.

"The common woolly monkey, brown woolly monkey, or Humboldt's woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha) is a woolly monkey from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and Venezuela. It lives in groups of two to 70 individuals, usually splitting the group into smaller subgroups when active. Taxonomy
The taxonomy of the common woolly monkey is still debated. Fooden classified it is as one of two species under the genus Lagothrix with four sub-species (L. l. lagotricha, L. l. lugens, L. l. cana, and L. l. poeppgigii. Later, an analysis of craniodental morphology suggested a move of all sub-species to the species level and also led to the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (formerly Lagothrix flavicauda) being moved to a monotypic genus Oreonax. Genetic analyses also identify distinct groups, but different groupings from morphological and molecular data continue to make this a difficult issue that might be addressed with larger data sets. A 2014 study found the genus Lagothrix to comprise only two species: L. lagothrica and L. flavicauda, with L. lagothrica containing five subspecies; the results of this study have been followed by the American Society of Mammalogists and the IUCN Red List.",1

", also known as Attorney General v. Khan, is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government cannot compel a person to provide genetic information to a government agency.

", also known as Attorney General v Ahkter, is an English family law Court of Appeal case concerning the validity of an Islamic ceremony of marriage. A woman who recently divorced her husband petitioned the court to determine whether the marriage, resulting from a Nikah, was void marriage or a non-marriage. The Family Court had held the marriage was void, granting her financial remedies. The Court of Appeal subsequently reversed the decision and denied financial remedies. The case received much scholarly and media attention on the requirements for marriage and the protection of vulnerable spouses. Context 
The Marriage Act 1949 and Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 set out conditions for a marriage ceremony to be recognized as valid, void, voidable or outside the Marriage Acts. A valid marriage satisfies all the conditions in the Marriage Acts; the parties may benefit from all the legal consequences such as equitable division of property and pension sharing. A void marriage fails one of the 'essential requirements' in the Marriage Act; a decree of nullity can be granted which allows the parties to get the same financial remedies as on divorce. A voidable marriage is one that can be annulled at the option of one of the parties if one of the grounds are met. A 'non-marriage' is outside the Marriage Acts, with the parties treated as cohabiting couples.",1

"A web portal is a specially designed website that brings information from diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together in a uniform way. Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include mashups and intranet ""dashboards"" for executives and managers. The extent to which content is displayed in a ""uniform way"" may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content. Very often design emphasis is on a certain ""metaphor"" for configuring and customizing the presentation of the content (e.g., a dashboard or map) and the chosen implementation framework or code libraries. In addition, the role of the user in an organization may determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration. A portal may use a search engine's application programming interface (API) to permit users to search intranet content as opposed to extranet content by restricting which domains may be searched.

"In mechanics, the net force is the result of the two forces acting on a body. It is the sum of the forces acting on the body, and it is directed away from the center of mass.",0
"In mechanics, the net force is the vector sum of forces acting on a particle or object. The net force is a single force that replaces the effect of the original forces on the particle's motion. It gives the particle the same acceleration as all those actual forces together as described by Newton's second law of motion. It is possible to determine the torque associated with the point of application of a net force so that it maintains the movement of jets of the object under the original system of forces. Its associated torque, the net force, becomes the resultant force and has the same effect on the rotational motion of the object as all actual forces taken together.  It is possible for a system of forces to define a torque-free resultant force. In this case, the net force, when applied at the proper line of action, has the same effect on the body as all of the forces at their points of application. It is not always possible to find a torque-free resultant force.",1

This caused conflict between Wolkenstein and his classmates. One of them called Wolkenstein as ""zhyd"" and Wolkenstein slapped him in the face. For this assault and battery, Wolkenstein was expelled from gymnasium. After that, Chekhov induced classmates to write a collective statement that all of them would leave the gymnasium if Wolkenstein was not reinstated. That had an effect, and he was reinstated and later graduated from gymnasium.",1

"Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, located in the village of Fetteresso, in the Scottish Borders. It is a Category A listed building.

The castle was built in the 14th century by the Maxwell family. The first documented owner of the castle was Sir David Maxwell of Fetteresso, who was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The castle passed through several hands before being acquired by the Drummond family in the 16th century. The Drummond family were responsible for some major alterations to the castle, including the addition of a walled courtyard and tower. The Drummond family remained in ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1782, when it was sold to Colonel George Maxwell. The Maxwell family retained ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1935, when it was sold to the National Trust for Scotland.

Today, Fetteresso Castle is open to the public and is used as a museum. It is also used as a venue for events, such as weddings and ballads gatherings.",0
"Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway.  Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory
From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.",1

"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.",0
"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.",1

Nanao Castle is located on the southeastern side of Noto Peninsula facing the Sea of Japan. The area was important from the Nara period due to its good port and connections with neighbouring provinces. In 1408, Hatakeyama Mitsunori, from a branch line of the Hatakeyama clan, was appointed governor of Noto Province and first constructed a castle at this location around the year 1408. Although the main Hatakeyama clan diminished in power and influence with the growing strength of the Ashikaga clan under the Muromachi shogunate, the Hatakeyama in Noto ruled their area as a semi-independent fief. Hatakeyama Yoshifusa (1491-1545) expanded Nanao Castle into a huge fortress. However, after his death, the Hatakeyama suffered from internal conflicts with the clan and with increasing restive powerful retainers, and problems with the Ikkō-ikki movement.",1

"V391 Pegasi b, also known as HS 2201+2610 b, is an extrasolar planet candidate orbiting the star V391 Pegasi approximately 4,570 light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus. The candidate planet was discovered by means of variable star timing, which measured anomalies in variability of the star caused by a planet. It is the first planet candidate to claim to be detected with this method. The discovery reported the planet candidate to have mass of 3.2 times Jupiter's (assuming an edge-on orbit), semi-major axis of 1.7 AU, and orbital period of 1,170 days. The planet candidate was discovered in March 2007 and published in September 2007. If it is confirmed, its survival would indicate that planets at Earth-like distances can survive their star's red-giant phase, though this is a much larger planet than Earth (about the same size as Jupiter and Saturn). Its existence has been called into question with further monitoring of the pulsations of the star which show deviations from the predicted behavior if this were in fact a planet. The variations in the pulsations may be due to unknown stellar variability.",1

"Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.

Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.

Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.

Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law. It undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary and can lead to a spiral of corruption and violence. Governments must take measures to protect judges and prosecutors from attack, and they must ensure that investigations into judicial murder are carried out vigorously and impartially.",0
"Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.",1

"Flook was a location-based browsing application and website developed by Ambient Industries located in the United Kingdom, initially for the iPhone. Users of the application created virtual cards, or ""Flooks"", which were made up of a photo of a particular location and a small piece of text describing that location. These Flooks were then recorded with their geographic coordinates so that other Flook users could see where they have been posted when they are using the app. Users typically upload local secrets, places to go and things to see. The application was therefore a wiki of sorts, but was also a combination of Google Maps, StumbleUpon and review websites such as Tripadvisor or Toptable. Ambient Industries was founded by two former Symbian programmers, Roger Nolan and Jane Sales, who assisted in the construction of much of the Symbian mobile operating system, together with Tristan Brotherton, formerly of Synapsim, Roo and Fluidjuice, and who assisted in the creation of screening software that is now used by Kroll.

"Eric Alan Hanushek (; born May 22, 1950) is an American economist who has made significant contributions to the field of education and economic research. He is currently the Raymond A. Mason Professor of Economics at Stanford University, where he also served as the provost from 2002 to 2006.

Hanushek has written extensively on economics, education, and policy issues. He is best known for his work in labor economics, which has focused on the determinants of wages and employment in both the United States and other countries. His most influential work has demonstrated that while there are many factors that determine wages and employment levels, human capital (i.e., skills) is a dominant determinant of wage levels. Furthermore, Hanushek has demonstrated that while government intervention can improve employment opportunities and wages for low-income groups, it typically does not have a large impact on the wages or employment levels of high-income individuals or groups.

Hanushek was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 22, 1950. He received his B.A. from Brown University in 1972 and his M.A. from Yale University in 1973. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1978, after which he joined the faculty at Stanford University.",0

He was awarded the Yidan Prize for Education Research in 2021. Hanushek advocates using economic analysis to improve student performance. He has authored numerous, highly cited articles on the effects of class size reduction, high-stakes accountability, teacher effectiveness, and other education related topics.   In a 1971 paper he introduced the concept of evaluating teacher effectiveness on the basis of student learning gains. This idea is the basis of value-added assessments of teacher quality. In his most recent book, The Knowledge Capital of Nations, Hanushek concludes that the quality of education is causally related to economic growth.",1
"The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed. The flowers are arranged in spikelike inflorescences, each with a few small sepals and petals. The fruit is a tiny Capsicum, typically a pepper but sometimes a fruit that resembles a tomato. The genus Capparis contains the typical capers (Capparis spinosa) and the related genus Ceratonia contains the false capers (Ceratonia siliqua), which have edible fruits resembling those of the true capers.

The capers are native to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and North America. They have been naturalized in many other parts of the world. They grow best in slightly alkaline soil with good drainage and moderate fertility.",0
"The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales. As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.",1

The series was eventually collected as the trade paperback Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors. Overview
The series focuses on a young boy named Todd Casil, otherwise known as Squee. An introverted and bullied little kid with a less than supportive family, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only results in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise further humiliated. Squee's mother is addicted to some form of pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. His father, painfully aware of Squee's existence, loathes the boy and never forgets to mention that he blames Squee for ""ruining"" his life, claiming that he ""hasn't smiled once since [Squee] was born"". Having little patience for anything Squee says or does, he eventually becomes convinced that Squee is mentally unstable, and by the end of the series, has him committed to the ""Defective Head Meat Institute"". Squee also has a grandfather who justifiably believes his children are only waiting for him to die to collect some kind of inheritance. His grandfather claims to keep healthy and young by consuming his children's first-borns, and subsequently attempts to devour Squee, only to reveal in horrifying fashion that he is in fact a cyborg and quite possibly insane.",1

"Alström's warbler, or plain-tailed warbler (Phylloscopus soror) is a small passerine bird in the Old World warbler family Phylloscopidae. It is found in east Africa from Somalia to Mozambique, and south to Namibia and Botswana.

The Alström's warbler is a small passerine bird, measuring 14–16 cm in length. The male has a plain brown back and wings, while the female is much paler with a more extensive white band across the breast. The underparts are also white, shading to buff on the belly. The head is mainly brown, with a yellowish supercilium (eyeline) and brown eye-ring. There is a black stripe through the eye and another one through the bill. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller with less yellow on the head. This is a shy bird that mainly occurs in open woodland or scrub, but will also fly into open grasslands or even towns if disturbed.

The Alström's warbler feeds on insects and seeds, usually picking its way through dense vegetation. It is an active bird that forages on the ground or in low trees. It nests in a tree well away from other birds, constructing a neat cup of grass, feathers and mud. The male incubates the eggs for 14 days, before feeding the young fledglings. This species is not endangered but its range is shrinking due to conversion of its habitat to agriculture or urban development.",0

In the UK, however, lower and more variable thresholds are used (<18 mg/dl at any time OR baby with abnormal clinical signs and a single value <45 mg/dl OR baby at risk of impaired metabolic adaptation but without abnormal clinical signs and a measurement <36 mg/dl and remaining <36 mg/dl at next measurement). The neonate's gestational age, birth weight, metabolic needs, and wellness state of the newborn has a substantial impact on the neonates blood glucose level. There are known risk factors that can be both maternal and neonatal. This is a treatable condition. Its treatment depends on the cause of the hypoglycemia. Though it is treatable, it can be fatal if gone undetected.  Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in newborns. Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs in between 1 in 3 births out of every 1,000 births but is hard to quantify internationally due to lack of consensus about diagnostic thresholds.",1

"Timberland Regional Library (TRL) is a public library system serving the residents of western Washington state, United States including Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston counties. Timberland Regional Library has 27 community libraries, 2 cooperative library centers, and 3 library kiosks. It was founded in 1968, following a four-year demonstration project, and is funded through property taxes and timber taxes. History
A two-year demonstration library system, the Timberland Library Demonstration (TLD), was established in 1964 to serve Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston counties, using $310,000 in funds from the federal Library Services and Construction Act and local sources. Each of the counties had cities with independent library systems and several rural library districts, including the Grays Harbor County Rural Library District and South Puget Sound Regional Library, who chose to either join or opt out of the demonstration project. The Timberland Library Demonstration relied on the Washington State Library to process its books, which were also stored in municipal libraries. The system debuted its bookmobile in September 1964, based in Centralia and traveling on ten routes between rural areas in all five counties. The formation of a permanent library district would require a public vote, which was pushed back from 1966 to 1968, waiting for a more favorable general election. The South Puget Sound Regional Library, which comprised Mason and Thurston counties, threatened to leave the demonstration later in 1966 over the effectiveness of the program for their counties. After months of negotiation, the two counties reversed their decision, allowing the demonstration project to continue for another two years.",1

"HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes (endonucleases) a type of prokaryotic DNA that protects organisms from unknown, foreign DNA. It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site—the place where it cuts DNA molecules—is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5′-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties
HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of HaeIII takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate.

"Tolerable daily intake (TDI) refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally acceptable daily intake (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a food additive which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk. For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred. Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on animal experiments, and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing no observable adverse effect (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species. Because the uncertainty factors (safety factors) may vary depending on the quality of data and the type of adverse effect, TDI values are not good estimates of the harmfulness of chemicals, and must be considered administrative tools to set allowable limits for chemicals, rather than scientific measures. The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects. References",1

"Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a situation in which two or more countries attempt to lower the value of their currencies to gain an advantage in exports over their rivals.

Currency wars have been observed throughout history, and are often the result of bilateral trade deficits. One country may attempt to reduce the value of its currency in order to make its exports more competitive, while the opposing country may respond by doing the same. This process can lead to a sustained decrease in the value of currencies, which can have negative consequences for both economies.",0
"Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall in relation to other currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more and more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries. Historically, competitive devaluations have been rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain a high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.",1

"A self bow or simple bow is a bow made from a single piece of wood. Extra material such as horn nocks on the ends, or built-up handles, would normally be accepted as part of a self bow. Some modern authorities would also accept a bow spliced together in the handle from two pieces of wood. Comparison with composite bows 
An effective self bow can be made from widely available local material in most inhabited parts of the world, with limited tools whose functions include chopping, shaving, and scraping. A day of work may be needed, starting with a seasoned stave; a composite bow requires a week's work, and could possibly take up to several years, starting with a much greater range of materials and skills. Self bows must be approximately the height of the archer if they are to allow a long draw, and they are less efficient in the specialized art of flight archery.  Well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight give higher arrow velocity, and the bow itself is shorter. However, the hide glue that holds a composite bow together absorbs water and will dissolve if soaked; the wood of self bows is less sensitive to humidity. ",1

"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.

Interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The basic idea is that humans are not just individual actors but are also members of social groups, which shapes their behaviour. Social interaction is thus seen as a key factor in understanding human behaviour.

Interactionism has a number of important implications for sociology. First, it emphasises the role of social norms and values in shaping behaviour.Second, it emphasises the importance of contextuality in understanding human behaviour. Finally, it stresses the importance of social interaction as a means of learning and understanding behaviour.

Interactionism has also had an important impact on the methodology of sociology. It has led to the development of social process theory and action research, two important methodological approaches within sociology.",0
"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.",1

"Kristina från Duvemåla (""Kristina from Duvemåla"") is a Swedish musical written by former ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus (lyrics) and Benny Andersson (music). It is based on a series of four novels by Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg detailing a family's poverty-driven migration from Sweden to America in the mid-19th century: The Emigrants (1949), Unto a Good Land (1952), The Settlers (1956), and The Last Letter Home (1959).

The show premiered at the Malmö Opera and Music Theatre in Malmö, Sweden, on 7 October 1995 and received a rapturous welcome. The audience gave it a 10-minute standing ovation, while the critics unanimously praised it. Martin Nyström of Dagens Nyheter wrote that Andersson and Ulvaeus ""created a great Swedish musical that thematically touches on the great questions of our time"" and compared Andersson's musicality with that of Schubert; while Svenska Dagbladets Carl-Gunnar Åhlén concluded that Björn Ulvaeus ""succeeded in presenting the drama without getting bogged down, despite its almost Wagnerian length.""

A  goldsmith banker was a businessperson who acted as banker for goldsmiths. They would lend money to goldsmiths to purchase materials and coins to create jewelry and other objects.,0
"A  goldsmith banker was a business role that emerged in seventeenth century London from the London goldsmiths where they gradually expanded their services to include storage of wealth, providing loans, transferring money and providing bills of exchange that would lead to the development of cheques.  Some of the concepts were brought over from Amsterdam where goldsmiths would provide gold storage and issue chits that started to be used as a means of exchange.  The goldsmith banker became a key development in the history of banking that would lead to modern banking. History
Their emergence was gradual: exchanging goldsmiths, who dealt in coinage, started to become recognised as carrying out a different activity from a working goldsmith in the 1630s. Prior to that date banking in London was principally carried out by foreigners, generally Italians, Germans, and the Dutch. However this innovation led to an indigenous banking tradition. The seizure of the mint by Charles I in 1640 created anxiety about the safe storage of valuables, which was further increased during the English Civil War, which also disrupted the regular work of the working goldsmiths. They soon developed accountancy practices to keep track of deposits. Then they also started paying interest on deposits so they could loan out increasing quantities of gold. The depositor was given a receipt with their name and the amount of the deposit. Such receipts became negotiable and thus evolved into the bank note.",1
"David Greig was the supermarket (initially grocery store) chain he founded in 1966. The company operated under the name David Greig Supermarkets until it was sold to the Safeway chain in 1987. 

Greig's supermarkets were noted for their large, well-organized aisles and their wide variety of foods and beverages. The company also had a strong focus on customer service, with employees known for their friendliness and willingness to help.

Greig's supermarkets were particularly popular in the Vancouver area, where they operated more than 20 stores. However, the company's popularity also led to widespread competition from other supermarket chains, including Safeway and Metro. In 1987, Greig's was sold to Safeway, which closed most of the stores that year.",0
"David Greig was the supermarket (initially grocery shop) chain founded by the Greig family of Hornsey, north London. With its headquarters at Atlantic Road, Brixton (and later at Waterloo Road, London) and grocery shops across southern England, it was a rival to the Sainsbury's chain, John and Mary Sainsbury having opened their first grocery shop in Holborn one year earlier. A deep personal rivalry developed between the two families, because of acrimonious feelings about the Greigs' alleged betrayal of a verbal agreement regarding the purchasing of sites for development. The David Greig chain is considered to have been established in 1870, when the wife of a Hornsey cabinet maker of Scots birth opened a small provisions shop at 32 High Street, Hornsey. By 1881 her son David Greig had joined her in the business and described himself as a 'provision dealer' in the census of that year. The business thrived and wishing to expand beyond Hornsey, Greig opened his first shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton in 1888, initially ""anchoring"" the nascent Brixton Market, which started in Atlantic Road in the 1870s and was so successful that it spread to Brixton Road before being relocated to Brixton Station Road plus several purpose built covered arcades and finally also Electric Avenue, to reduce congestion and allow further growth. Around 1890 a second shop was opened at nearby Loughborough Junction, near Brixton. This was probably the shop at 232 Coldharbour Lane where a wooden ‘David Greig’ fascia with ‘Brilliant cut’ gilded lettering in the distinctive serif typeface of the chain, was uncovered in 2020. ",1

In a contemporary review for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, praising its ""extended"" versions of songs from Physical Graffiti, but finding that they do not add anything new to the material. Erlewine also called Robert Plant's vocals ""surprisingly strong"" given his age, but criticised John Paul Jones for sounding ""a bit too much like a sideman"".

"The genus Dendragapus  contains two closely related species of grouse that have often been treated as a single variable taxon (blue grouse). The two species are the dusky grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) and the sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).  In addition, the spruce grouse and Siberian grouse have been considered part of this genus. Description
These are large grouse that inhabit highland regions of North America and Eurasia. The sooty grouse is found in the Pacific Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada, and the dusky grouse in the Rocky Mountains. These two taxa were originally regarded as separate species, but were considered conspecific for much of the twentieth century. However, in 2006 the American Ornithologists' Union re-split them, following the DNA-based work of Barrowclough et al. (2004). whose results supported the earlier work of Brooks (1929) who regarded the two taxa as separate species based on morphology, behavior and vocalizations. The precise ranges of the two species are well-defined in the south, separated by extensive areas of unsuitable forest-free habitat, but somewhat uncertain in the north of the range of the genus where there is no separation; Barrowclough et al.'s study did not include these northern populations.",1

In 1977, fifteen years before the Bosnian War ravaged their lives, Halima's (Alma Prica) niece Safija (Olga Pakalović) became pregnant by Slavomir (Mijo Jurišić), a Serb man. Beaten and ostracized by her Bosniak family, Safija gave the infant boy to the childless Halima to raise, telling Slavomir it was stillborn. Twenty-three years later, the devastating war has ended. Bodies are being identified through DNA samples and returned to families for burial. Halima's husband is found, but Mirza's bones cannot be returned to her without a blood sample. And that would have to come from Safija who ran away years ago and married Slavomir. When Halima finally locates her, Safija refuses the blood test because she is afraid her husband will discover her deception. And other deceptions could be uncovered as well, including the shocking identity of the soldier who took Halima's husband and the boy to their deaths.",1

In 1958, the Special Air Service (SAS) was temporarily based at Merebrook Camp in Malvern, Worcestershire, a former emergency military hospital that had remained largely unused since 1945. In 1960, the SAS moved to a former Royal Artillery boys' training unit, Bradbury Lines in Hereford, which was renamed in 1984 to Stirling Lines in honour of the regiment's founder, Lieutenant Colonel David Stirling. In 1994, the RAF ceased using RAF Credenhill, the Army then obtaining the site to redevelop as a new base for the SAS; works commenced in 1997. The SAS commenced relocation of staff and equipment to Credenhill from Hereford with the redevelopment of the site. The move was completed in May 1999. On 30 September 2000, the official opening ceremony was held for the new Stirling Lines with the clock tower re-erected on the new parade ground.

"Dog Man Star is the second album by American rock band the Darkness, released in 1982.

The Darkness emerged from the ashes of the pioneering Detroit heavy metal band Death, founded by guitarist and songwriter Rob Halford. The Darkness had a relatively successful career in the early 1980s; their self-titled debut album peaked at number 73 on the Billboard 200 chart, and spawned the hit single ""I Want Out"". However, after subsequent releases failed to achieve the same level of success, the Darkness disbanded in 1986.

Five years later, in 1991, Halford reformed the band with new members and recorded Dog Man Star. The album was well received by critics and fans alike and spawned two more charting singles in ""Love Is Only a Dream"" and ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"". In 2001, Dog Man Star was certified silver by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies in the US.",0
"Dog Man Star is the second album by English alternative rock band Suede, released in October 1994 on Nude Records. The album was recorded in London at Master Rock studios in early 1994, and was produced by Ed Buller. It was the last Suede album to feature guitarist Bernard Butler; growing tensions between him and singer Brett Anderson ended with Butler leaving the band before recording was complete. As a result, some tracks on the album had to be finished with the assistance of session musicians. In contrast to their debut album Suede, which exhibited the influences of David Bowie and the Smiths, Dog Man Star exhibits a more varied aesthetic and draws from a wider range of influences. Although it did not sell on the same scale as its predecessor, it reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified as gold by the BPI in November 1994. Described by Rolling Stone as ""one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label,"" the record was released in a different UK musical climate to their hitherto discography. Out-of-step with the mainstream music scene, it featured the band diverting away from the ""Britpop pack"" of bands.",1
"Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq IV was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Twenty-second Dynasty. He ruled from 945 BC to 925 BC.

Shoshenq IV was the son of Hedjkheperre Setepenre and his wife Tiy-Merenese. He was the successor of his father, who probably died during the battle against the Libyans in 945 BC. According to a stela from Abydos, Shoshenq IV was buried in a tomb near the pyramid of Menkaure, and he was succeeded by his son, Takelot I.

Shoshenq IV is most noted for his Great Inscription, which records the Donation of the Index of Thoth and other monuments from Karnak. The inscription reads:

""Year 5, 3rd month of Shoshenq III, day 22,
""The great king, Shoshenq III, beloved of Ra, given life, triumphant in battle - he establishes for all time a monument to himself in the sacred temple of Amun at Karnak.""

Also notable is his papyri collection, now in the British Museum.",0
"Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq IV was an ancient Egyptian ruler of the 22nd Dynasty, between the reigns of Shoshenq III and Pami. In 1986, David Rohl proposed that there were two king Shoshenqs bearing the prenomen Hedjkheperre – (i) the well-known founder of the dynasty, Hedjkheperre Shoshenq I, and (ii) a later pharaoh from the second half of the dynasty, whom Rohl called Hedjkheperre Shoshenq (b) due to his exact position in the dynasty being unknown. Following Rohl's proposal (first suggested to him by Pieter Gert van der Veen in 1984), the British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson supported the new king's existence by demonstrating that the earlier Hedjkheperre Shoshenq bore simple epithets in his titulary, whereas the later Hedjkheperre Shoshenq's epithets were more complex. Dodson suggested that the ruler that Kenneth Kitchen, in his standard work on Third Intermediate Period chronology, had numbered Shoshenq IV – bearing the prenomen Usermaatre – should be removed from the 22nd Dynasty and replaced by Rohl's Hedjkheperre Shoshenq (b), renumbering the latter as Shoshenq IV. At the same time the old Usermaatre Shoshenq IV was renumbered as Shoshenq VI. Dodson's historical summary of the new King Shoshenq IV's discovery and his supportive evidence for that king's independent existence from Hedjkheperre Shoshenq I appeared in an article entitled ‘A New King Shoshenq Confirmed?’ in 1993.",1

"The Bendidia was an ancient Athenian festival celebrating the Thracian goddess Bendis.  It was celebrated on the 19th day of the month of Thargelion (late May, in the Gregorian calendar), and was introduced in 429 BC.  The festival took place in the Piraeus.  It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens – six miles from the sanctuary – was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.  The horse race was followed by an all-night celebration, though the precise details of the remainder of the festival are unknown.",1

Born in Thiruvarur, she was brought up at Moovalur, a village near Mayiladhuthurai. She was the author of the 1936 novel Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor (lit.

She took part in the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the Devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar. She became a supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's protégé C. N. Annadurai.

A philatelic cover is an envelope prepared for the mailing of philatelic material. It is usually made of thick paper and has a stiff flap that is attached to the front cover. The flap is designed to protect the philatelic material inside from being damaged in transit.,0
"A philatelic cover is an envelope prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item. Stamp collectors began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward.  While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially first day covers and cacheted covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo'.  Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system. Often a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch.

"Developmental psychology is the scientific study of the psychological development of individuals from birth to adulthood. It covers a range of topics, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.

Development is a process that starts at conception and continues until the individual reaches adulthood. Developmental psychologists study how different experiences shape an individual's psychological development. They use a variety of research methods, including surveys, interviews, and laboratory experiments.

The field of developmental psychology is growing rapidly. New research is being published every day, and the field is attracting new professionals who are exploring new ways to understand human development. The scope of developmental psychology is vast, and it offers insights into everything from how children learn to think and feel to the origins of mental disorders.",0
"Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development. Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation. Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factors. This includes the social context and the built environment. Ongoing debates in regards to developmental psychology include biological essentialism vs. neuroplasticity and stages of development vs. dynamic systems of development.",1

"Ra Meliga, also known as Melaga or Maleka, was a Chudasama king of Saurashtra region of western India who reigned from 1400 CE to 1416 CE (VS 1456 to VS 1472). He remove his capital from Vanthali back to Junagadh, from which place he expelled the thanadar appointed by Gujarat Sultan. Thus Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I sent an army against Junagadh. He captured Vanthali and later Junagadh was besieged. Meliga left to a fort on Girnar hill which was inaccessible to the forces. So the forces left and placed two officers in Junagadh to collect tribute. Meliga died and was succeeded by his son Jayasimha II in 1416 CE. Reign
Meliga succeeded his elder brother Mandalika II in 1400 CE. His father Mokalasimha had to move the capital from Junagadh to Vanthali due to order from the Governor of Gujarat Zafar Khan on behalf of Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq who placed a thanadar. It seems that Meliga had played no role when Zafar Khan attacked Somnath temple in 1402 CE which was under repair. Meliga expelled the thanadar from Junagadh and again made it his capital. According to the Mandalika Kavya, he had sheltered a Jhala chieftain (probably Satarsal) fleeing from Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I. Mirat-i-Sikandari tells that, in 1413-14 CE, Ahmad Shah marched against Junagadh. On this occasion, Melinga fought a pitched battle with Ahmad Shah at Vanthali but was defeated and fled to Junagadh. Vanthali was taken by Ahmad Shah who then marched to Junagadh and took the lower fortress (the Uparkot but the Raja escaped by fleeing to the upper fortress of Girnar.

Ahmad Shah left two officers,  Sayad Ábûl Khair and Sayad Kásim, were left to collect the zamindar'''s tribute, salami and returned to his capital, Ahmedabad. The inscriptions (VS 1469/1413 CE) on five paliyas (memorial stones) of people died in battle at Vanthali corroborate this event. ",1

From this, the land rises sharply to the east and opposite to the west while remaining level in between.

The original chords and melody for ""Starless"" were written by John Wetton, who intended the song to be the title track of the group's previous album Starless and Bible Black. Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford initially disliked the song and declined to record it for that album. Instead the group chose an instrumental improvisation as the title track.

"The caper story is a subgenre of the detective story. It usually involves a theft, a crime, and the efforts of the police to solve the crime.

"The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction.  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.  The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr's criminal talents to solve murders.",1

The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""This three-part saga about Rose (the talented newcomer played by Essie Davis) is absorbing enough that you'll forgive McClaren for not finding a more interesting or challenging subject."" 

IGN's Dan Stiles awarded the miniseries 8 out of 10 and called it ""a beautifully shot and well-acted period drama"".

"Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part miniseries created for HBO by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969 in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in the previous year. Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime.

"The Heinkel HeS 011 or Heinkel-Hirth 109-011 (HeS - Heinkel Strahltriebwerke) was an advanced World War II jet engine built by Heinkel-Hirth. It featured a unique compressor arrangement, starting with a low-compression impeller in the intake, followed by a ""diagonal"" stage similar to a centrifugal compressor, and then a three-stage axial compressor. Many of the German jet-powered aircraft designs at the end of the war were designed to use the HeS 011, but the HeS 011 engine was not ready for production before the war ended in Europe and only small numbers of prototypes were produced. Design and development
Starting in 1936, Junkers started a jet engine development project under the direction of Wagner and Müller, who worked on axial compressor designs. By 1940 they had progressed to the point of having a semi-working prototype, which could not run under its own power and required an external supply of compressed air.",1

"Vitamin E is a group of eight water-soluble vitamins. It is essential for human health and is found in a variety of foods.

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and can be found in animal and vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. It is also found in some fortified foods and supplements.

Vitamin E is important for the immune system, reproductive health, and heart health. It may help prevent cancer and other diseases.

There are different types of vitamin E: alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of vitamin E), beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and tocopherol acetate.",0
"Vitamin E is a group of eight fat soluble compounds that include four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Vitamin E deficiency, which is rare and usually due to an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather than from a diet low in vitamin E, can cause nerve problems. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. Worldwide, government organizations recommend adults consume in the range of 3 to 15 mg per day. As of 2016, consumption was below recommendations according to a worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies that reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg per day for alpha-tocopherol. Research with alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement, with daily amounts as high as 2,000 mg per day, has had mixed results. Population studies suggested that people who consumed foods with more vitamin E, or who chose on their own to consume a vitamin E dietary supplement, had lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dementia, and other diseases, but placebo-controlled clinical trials could not always replicate these findings. As of 2017, vitamin E continues to be a topic of active clinical research. There is no clinical evidence that use of vitamin E skincare products are effective. Both natural and synthetic tocopherols are subject to oxidation, and so in dietary supplements are esterified, creating tocopheryl acetate for stability purposes.",1
"Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language.

Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language. It is a disorder of the left hemisphere of the brain, and is more common in older people. It can be caused by a stroke, brain tumour, or head injury.

There is no known cure for global aphasia, but there are treatments available that can help improve language skills. Treatment typically includes speech therapy to help improve pronunciation and fluency, as well as rehabilitation programmes that focus on teaching essential daily living skills such as cooking and bathing. Some people may also require assistance with everyday activities such as reading and writing.

If you are affected by global aphasia, remember that you are not alone. There are many people who have faced challenges in their lives, but have managed to overcome them. You can too!",0
"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.",1

In January 1973, Edwards resigned from his position as vice president of the UMW amid allegations that he had conspired",0
"Nelson ""Jack"" Edwards (1917–1974) was Vice President of the UAW (United Auto Workers), and a founder of CBTU, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. Nelson Edwards was born in 1917 on a farm in Lowndes County, Alabama. In 1937 he moved to Detroit and worked at the Chrysler plant, where he became active in the local union. Inspired by his brother John, Edwards began his union career during the union growth of the 1930s. He was elected UAW Union steward to represent workers in Chrysler's Foundry plant. He was laid off from Chrysler in 1941, and later obtained a job at the Ford Lincoln Plant on Detroit’s west side. Immediately, Edwards became active in his new union, Local 900, at that time freely-recognized by the Ford Motor Company.  He served on the local’s education, citizenship, and by-laws committee and in 1944 was chosen to be chairman of that committee. Jack was involved in the civic and political life of Detroit, the State of Michigan, as well as the Nation for many years where he made substantial contributions.",1

"The Sadler 29 is a popular British sailing yacht designed by David Sadler. Over 400 Sadler 29s were produced.  In April 1988 the Sadler 29 was the oldest design to take part in Yachting World’s Mini Rally. Construction
The hull is made of GRP with a full GRP inner molding, the space between these skins is filled with polyurethane foam, this meant the boat is unsinkable in the event of taking on water.  If the boat should become full of water she should still float according to the famous Archimedes principle.  The old naval wartime experience that ""your ship is your best lifeboat"" helps explain why designers thought that there was a need for an unsinkable yacht to promote further safety at sea.  Fire could still sink such a vessel, this method of construction should be viewed as one of the many design features that can help promote safety-at-sea.

"An elder or progenitor race, in science fiction, is a hypothetical intelligent species older than humanity. They are sometimes said to be the descendants of advanced civilizations that perished or were destroyed, or of long-extinct species. The term is often used in the context of speculative fiction, where it may be used to denote an advanced society or civilisation that is neither human nor machine.",0
"An elder or progenitor race, in science fiction, fantasy, or horror fiction, is an ancient race that not only preceded but helped shape the races that followed, often playing a significant role in the basis of the story. Humanity may have been descended from them, or they may be a different fictional race, such as elves, dwarves, or aliens. While in some cases, whether they currently exist is unclear, in other instances, members of an elder race still inhabit the world, either openly or in secret. In order to hide their existence, they may make use of a wainscot society, inhabit a parallel universe, only visiting the current one occasionally, or disguise themselves as a fool, deity, magician or trickster. One such example is in Lord of Light (1967), where highly advanced humans take on the identities of Hindu deities and act as gods to the less advanced colonists. Elder races are typically either technologically or spiritually powerful, as well as wise. While sometimes benevolent, assisting younger races, they can also often be amoral, as in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, where the Elder Gods are indifferent to humanity's ""petty"" concerns. They are usually presented as having drifted apart from humanity in the present of the story, sometimes as lost empires whose inhabitants either left their former home for a new one, or were destroyed by a catastrophe and only live on in legend, such as Atlantis. They may appear both as enemies, or as allies against a greater threat.",1
"Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EW) of a resin. The EW is a measure of the weight of a resin in terms of an equivalent volume of pure epoxy.

Epoxy resins are generally classified according to their curing method, which affects their epoxy value. Two curing methods are direct cure and indirect cure. Direct cure epoxy resins have a higher epoxy value than indirect cure resins because they require less curing time.",0
"Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) or Weight Per Epoxide (WPE) and is a measure of the epoxy content of an epoxy resin or epoxy functional diluent. This is an important parameter as it allows determination of the correct mix ratio of an epoxy system with a curing agent. The epoxide equivalent weight is usually measured first and done by titration. The standard test method is ASTM D1652 though this has been modified by certain states of the USA. The epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) maybe defined as: the number of grams of epoxy resin required to give 1 mole of epoxy groups. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. Example calculations 
Polyoxypropylene diglycidyl ether a  reactive diluent with the trade name of Diluent F has an average molecular weight of 1000 and a functionality of 2 so the EEW is 1000/2 = 500.The epoxy group content (EGC) is a term which arises from the EEW and is usually found in the literature with units of m.mol/kg. So from the units it can be deduced that an epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 as above, has an epoxy group content of 1000000/191 = 5236 m.mol/kg. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. So as an example using the epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 and a molar mass of 382, the epoxy value is calculated as follows: 382g gives 2 moles of epoxy groups and therefore 100g = 100/382 x 2 = 0.53  i.e. the epoxy value of the resin is 0.53.",1
