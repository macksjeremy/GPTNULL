///Sexhow railway station was a railway station built to serve the hamlet of Sexhow in North Yorkshire, England. The station was on the North Yorkshire and Cleveland's railway line between  and , which opened in 1857. The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby & Pickering Railway at . Sexhow station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located  south of Stockton, and  west of Battersby railway station. History
The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as . Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with  railway station, which was originally named Carlton.///,1

///In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.///,1
